# instructions
The tests are written in Ruby and use Selenium-Webdriver to autommate the browser. Test runner is Rspec. 

Please install the above to be able to run these tests.

I've used Sublime Text as the IDE. When running, use 'rspec' followed by the name of the test file.

I've used inline comments within the test code explaining the steps where necessary.

Thanks.
